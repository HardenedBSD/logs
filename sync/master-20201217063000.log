==== BEGIN: master ====
current branch: master
mergeable branch: github/master
==== change branch ====
Already on 'master'
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 14 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
==== show current branch ====
* master
==== check for stale changes ====
==== update to latest origin ====
warning: Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is
discouraged. You can squelch this message by running one of the following
commands sometime before your next pull:

  git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
invocation.
