commands sometime before your next pull:

  git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)

You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
invocation.
