warning: Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is
discouraged. You can squelch this message by running one of the following
commands sometime before your next pull:

  git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
invocation.

HEAD is now at 9f80d1a2c03f MFC r368593: Clean up more resouces of an existing SCTP association in case of a restart. This fixes a use-after-free scenario, which was reported by Felix Wilhelm from Google in case a peer is able to modify the cookie. However, this can also be triggered by an assciation restart under some specific conditions.
