Switched to branch 'hardened/current/master'
Your branch and 'origin/hardened/current/master' have diverged,
and have 2 and 7 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

warning: Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is
discouraged. You can squelch this message by running one of the following
commands sometime before your next pull:

  git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
invocation.
