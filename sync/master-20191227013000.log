==== merge failed and clean up after ====
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.


It took 3.19 seconds to enumerate untracked files. 'status -uno'
may speed it up, but you have to be careful not to forget to add
new files yourself (see 'git help status').
nothing to commit, working tree clean
HEAD is now at 130d3730f416 Merge remote-tracking branch 'freebsd/master'
